  story: [
    `I am a software developer with a strong focus on Java backend engineering and 
system architecture, currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
While AI/ML is fascinating, my passion lies in building robust, scalable backend systems.`,
    
    `My work emphasizes clean design, security, and scalability, with hands-on experience building 
enterprise-style platforms and real-time collaboration systems. I have designed and implemented 
systems involving JWT authentication, role-based access control, REST APIs, WebSockets, and 
real-time communication.`,
    
    `I actively bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world engineering by building end-to-end 
applications using modern tools, cloud infrastructure, and best practices. I am particularly 
interested in backend systems where performance, reliability, and architectural clarity matter.`
